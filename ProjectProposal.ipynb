    "This is a question of interest because annual shootings in America has become quite common, expected and a pattern. Many questions have been raised to what proper solutions could address the shooting of innocence and although we ourselves may not be able to address the issue directly, we hope to derive information from the data to tell us whether there is a correlation to the issue if the solution gets implemented. There were 372 mass shootings in the US in 2015, killing 475 people and wounding 1,870, according to the Mass Shooting Tracker. The existing problem of mass shooting comes from the loopholes in federal firearms laws of background checking, which requires licensed firearms dealers to sell guns but not unlicensed sellers. \n",

    "According to Firearm Acquisition Without Background Checks more than half of Americans acquired firearms with background checks, that is why we choose to investigate the correlation between background checks and shootings by states. The first reference is an article about the correlations between background checks and shootings. Research shows that there was a 40 percent decline in shooting when Connecticut implemented background checks on firearms. However, if we can see a correlation between states with most background checks to shooting, we can rebuke the study that background checks can make huge impacts on shootings at all. \n",
